        review: "My child was very close to us, but when he started school he would cry a lot when he couldn't see us. However, alhamdulillah within two weeks he adjusted to school and now he is attached to it. He no longer cries, instead he is happy and even enjoys studying. Alhamdulillah, The school and education are excellent, and the activities conducted for the kids are great. Renaissance Preschool is doing a wonderful job. May Allah bless you with further progress and elevate the reputation of your school.",
